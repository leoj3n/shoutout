If you'd like to hack on the code that drives Shoutout, please join us,
we'd love to have you.

## Goals, Design, Philosophy

Shoutout is an application designed to embrace the [Offline First][] and
[noBackend][] philosophies.

Our _Backend as a Service_ (BaaS) providers include:

- [Firebase][] as our backend.
- [TransloadIt][] for transcoding.
- [Divshot][] for hosting our static assets.

Shoutout is also designed mobile-first, and follows Google's
[material design principles][].

## Project Status

Shoutout is still young, and should be considered in alpha.

## Contributing

### Setup

`@TODO`

#### Commit Messages

The first line of a commit message (the summary line) is like the subject line
of an email. (See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)). A
short but complete summary line helps the maintainers respond to your pull
request more quickly.

#### Mind the Test Suite!

If you're making changes please write some tests for them! Also be sure to
run the whole test suite using `@TODO` before submitting (if you forget,
Codeship will do that for you and embarrass you in front of all your friends).

## Hanging Out

We're on [Gitter](../README.md#community). If you are going to develop for
Shoutout, it's a great idea to hang out with us there. Here's why:

- Just to be social!
- Discuss your thoughts before coding and maybe get new ideas.
